        This past month, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was confirmed as the Director
        General of the World Trade Organization. Across social media, excitement
        erupted about the significance of her position. Hashtags on twitter
        included #BeLikeNgozi, #BeLikeNgoziChallenge, and #JustLikeNgozi where
        women and their daughters joined an #AnkaraArmy in a manner that
        somewhat recalled Hilary Clinton’s #PantsuitNation. Many of the posts
        included inspirational messages about how her footprint would have many
        Africans in general and women in particular follow. Okonjo-Iweala
        herself weighed in, thanking the people for their support. Here are two
        of my favorites: So what was her journey, and what stands in the way of
        Africa producing more Dr. Okonjo-Iwealas? Every outlet you read
        emphasizes her global credentials. They stress the fact that she is
        Harvard-educated, and obtained her PhD in economics from MIT. They
        praise her long career at the World Bank, where she worked for over two
        decades, before moving to the Nigerian government. And after that was
        part of Africa’s global human capital, including chairing GAVI, the
        global vaccine alliance. When Covid-19 hit, she was part of a small
        group of Special Envoy of the African Union (AU) on Covid-19, calling
        for African debt relief. Indeed, a quick look at the other AU Envoys who
        were part of the same herculean efforts as NOI on behalf of the
        continent reveals people with globe-spanning educations and careers.
        Donald Kaberuka, the former president of the African Development Bank,
        studied in Scotland; Tidjane Thiam, ex-CEO of Credit Suisse, studied in
        Paris, and Mr Trevor Manuel, ex-minister of finance of South Africa,
        includes in his bio the fact that he has “ completed the Executive
        Management Programme – a joint programme between Stanford University and
        the National University of Singapore.” Because in global leadership, a
        world class education matters. Yet too often the pathway Dr.
        Okonjo-Iweala blazed is blithely condescended as “brain drain.” Africa
        gained because NOI spent her 20s in Boston and Washington DC. The
        continent continued to gain as she brought her lived experience (and
        Ankara!) to global decision making rooms. And Africa is gaining again as
        she steps in to steer a global trade institution in the midst of a
        global pandemic. She is at the helm of the WTO, an organization tasked
        with contributing to global recovery at a time when trade barriers,
        including vaccine nationalism and restrictions health commodity supply
        chains are on the rise. At 8B, we know many students like the young Dr
        Okonjo-Iweala. They have a high grit quotient; they overcome inordinate
        challenges to apply to and receive offers from the global universities
        of their dreams. They face resistance to their ambitions in the form of
        reduced access to funding or pressures to keep their talents in the home
        countries. They make a ritual of deferring/reapplying year after year
        until they have the money; which is the key barrier to enrollment. Early
        in Covid I was saying that we need more brain circulation because every
        country needs their own Anthony Fauci to manage the pandemic. What I
        really should be saying is that in every sector, Africa needs leaders
        who know the global rules of the game; have the confidence and
        perspectives to use those rules to shape national trajectories; and
        belong to rich international networks through which they can mobilize
        knowledge, opinion and capital to define and solve their problems.
        What’s more, the solutions we need for 21st Century challenges will need
        our best collective human efforts, and must include the under-tapped
        potential on the African continent. African students must access the
        excellence built in global universities over centuries, even as we start
        and continue our own home-built journeys to build future world class
        universities. That means more, not less, mobility for Africa’s ambitious
        students, that means more future Ngozi Okonjo-Iwealas empowered to
        stride elite global institutions.
