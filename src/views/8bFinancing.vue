                                    African students looking to attend universities outside their home countries typically need a cosigner, in part because they have little credit history. Moreover, because student loans are unsecured, i.e. they do not have collateral, they tend to be very expensive when available. We're changing that.

                            exhaust scholarship and grant options before making an application to 8B for financing.

                             past record of scholarship, and the amount of financing needed.
