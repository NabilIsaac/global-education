                    Why tertiary education?
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-base font-light leading-normal text-finlandia-500">
                    Africa’s prosperity requires a chorus of education solutions, ranging from addressing malnutrition 
                    and stunting, all the way to primary, secondary and tertiary education. But tertiary education is 
                    not a luxury. Research shows strong links between tertiary education and economic development, a 
                    link that cannot be wished away just because traditional approaches to financing such education have 
                    fallen short. Africa’s vastly unequal access to leading global universities will compound its 
                    disadvantage in the knowledge economy of the 21st century, where the ability to take advantage of 
                    opportunities will depend on having highly educated and globally connected ecosystem-builders in 
                    every sector. Put differently, tertiary education is a necessary component 
                    in Africa’s pathway to prosperity and sustainable development – though by no means a sufficient one.

                    How does 8B manage defaults?
                </p>
                <p class="mt-5 font-light text-finlandia-500">
                    We guard against student default through three processes:
                </p>
                <ol class="pl-4 list-decimal">
                    <li class="mt-2 text-base font-light leading-normal text-finlandia-500">
                        As part of our due diligence, we use all available data to assess default risk, 
                        then connect with students to understand their motivations. We also inform students of their 
                        loan obligations, 
                        as 8B education financing is likely to be the first loan obligation undertaken by African students.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mt-2 text-base font-light leading-normal text-finlandia-500">
                        8B’s origination and servicing capabilities are designed to reduce flight risk. 
                        Toward this end, 8B is building partnerships with entities in student home countries as well as 
                        globally. Further, 8B makes post-graduation repayments income-contingent, and maintains ongoing 
                        communication with graduates. In the unlikely event that we are unable to contact a student, 
                        the reputational guarantors who are 
                        named on a student’s application are contacted as every effort is made to reconnect with the student.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mt-2 text-base font-light leading-normal text-finlandia-500">
                        Much like loans in the US and elsewhere, students are informed prior to signing an agreement that 
                        non-repayments will be reported and have consequences for their personal credit score, which will 
                        affect their ability and that of other students with similar profiles- be they from the same country 
                        or program of study- to receive funding. As a result of these measures, we expect the levels default 
                        of our carefully selected students to be comparable to those of US college graduates from similar programs.
                    </li>

                    Does 8B promote braindrain?
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-base font-light leading-normal text-finlandia-500">
                    8B is designed to work with income-contingent repayments so that students have geographical flexibility. 
                    Additionally, in due course, we will develop a robust career development program aimed at reducing 
                    barriers to return to the continent. However, 8B does not presume to tell African students where they 
                    should live and make their careers. As a debate, it is worth noting that an active discussion 
                    continues on whether education outside Africa encourages the “brain circulation” necessary for 
                    Africa’s integration in a global economy, and is therefore a net gain, or whether it is an unmitigated 
                    loss that can be fairly characterized as “braindrain”. At 8B, we are convinced that on the whole, 
                    while acknowledging sectoral differences, there is merit in African talent being global. 
                    It gives us comfort that 193 countries have agreed to the Sustainable Development Goals, one of whose 
                    targets encourages the international community to substantively expand the number of scholarships 
                    available to African countries – suggesting that “brain circulation” is winning the argument. 
                    Practically, while Africa is in the process of building her own world-class universities – 
                    a process that deserves all the support possible – we see an obligation to work toward ensuring 
                    that Africa’s exceptional, 
                    creditworthy students can access world-class centers of learning and innovation today.

                    What is 8B’s role in career advancement for African students?
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-base font-light leading-normal text-finlandia-500">
                    8B is building the technology through which fellows will be knitted into a strong network 
                    that will accompany them on their pathway to success. The mentorship program through the 8B 
                    network will expose fellows to opportunities to forge 
                    relationships with individuals with experience in their field, supporting their pathways to success.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-5 text-xl font-regular text-finlandia-500">
                    How does 8B measure success?
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-base font-light leading-normal text-finlandia-500">
                    8B will consider itself successful if it can attract increasing amounts of capital into African 
                    student finance, which will in turn increase the number of African students who receive funding, 
                    graduate, obtain employment in their sectors of choice. Our target is to contribute to increasing 
                    African graduate students by 10x and unlocking $1billion in student financing by 2030. 
                    In a context of declining Official Development Assistance and competing causes for philanthropic 
                    dollars, we believe that 8B’s model is an example that can be used to unlock new 
                    financing for the development of the human capital required to meet the SDGs across all sectors.
